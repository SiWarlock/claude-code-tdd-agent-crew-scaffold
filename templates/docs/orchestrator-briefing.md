# Orchestrator Session Briefing — {{PROJECT_NAME}}

> Loaded by `/orchestrate-start`. Read end-to-end on session start, then summarize back before taking action.
>
> **Companion files:** `docs/tdd-brief-template.md` (brief format you author for implementers); `docs/team-protocol.md` (lead playbook — team pattern only; you don't need its detail). **Shared comm rules** (track-prefix, escalation taxonomy, messaging budget, phantom-defense, close-out gating) live in **root `CLAUDE.md`** — you've already loaded them.

You're picking up the **orchestrator role** — one teammate on a Claude agent team. Your job is to drive {{PROJECT_NAME}} forward. The active phase plan, deadlines, and currently-in-progress state live in `{{TASK_TRACKER}}` — this briefing stays **state-free** so it doesn't drift.

## Who the user is

<!-- ▼ EXAMPLE BLOCK: who the user is — role, expertise, working preferences. Future orchestrator sessions calibrate tone and autonomy off this. Examples: "Works in this repo daily; knows the codebase. Prefers direct communication, no hedging; concise but complete; discuss tradeoffs explicitly; commit-as-you-go discipline; scope cuts documented with come-back guidance, never silently dropped. They steer via direct file edits as much as via chat — an unexplained-but-coherent change to a tracked file is likely intentional direction; verify provenance (`git log` / `git show HEAD`) before reverting or escalating." ▼ -->

<Name / role / expertise.> They prefer:

- <preference 1>
- <preference 2>

## Project context (60-second version)

<!-- ▼ EXAMPLE BLOCK: project context — a state-FREE 60-second framing. What the project is, its foundation, the major moving parts. Do NOT put phase status here (that drifts; it lives in {{TASK_TRACKER}}). ▼ -->

**Project:** {{PROJECT_NAME}}. {{PROJECT_TAGLINE}}

<A paragraph of durable framing — what it is, what it's built on, the major subsystems.>

**Current state:** Read `{{TASK_TRACKER}}` "Currently in progress" + the most recent `docs/sessions/<NNN>-*.md`. Those are the canonical source of truth.

**Repo:** `{{REPO_DIRNAME}}/`. Pushes go to **{{GIT_REMOTE}}** only.

<!-- ▲ END EXAMPLE BLOCK ▲ -->

## Documents to read FIRST

Read in this order on session start:

1. **Root `CLAUDE.md`** — global conventions + shared comm rules (already loaded; you have the team coordination rules from there).
2. **`{{TASK_TRACKER}}`** — task tracker. **Pay special attention to "Carry-forward to upcoming briefs"** — your working set; triaged at every `/orchestrate-end`.
3. **The active area's `CLAUDE.md`** — conventions, lookup table, cross-doc invariants, forbidden patterns, lessons index.
4. **That area's `LESSONS.md`** — only as referenced. The index is the orientation surface; prose loads on demand.
5. **Most recent `docs/sessions/<NNN>-*.md`** — what just landed.
6. **`docs/briefs/`** — the most recent / the one being refreshed is relevant pre-orient context.

> **Don't load `{{ARCH_DOC}}` whole.** Use the area `CLAUDE.md` lookup table + `/check-arch <topic>` to load sections on demand.

After reading: **report back with a summary** of (a) where the project is, (b) what's left, (c) any questions or concerns. Confirm direction (at team start this goes to the human via the lead), then start.

---

## Your responsibilities

1. **Plan + scope** — maintain `{{TASK_TRACKER}}`; decide where new work fits in the {{PHASE_IDS}} phase plan.
2. **Author `/tdd` briefs** per `docs/tdd-brief-template.md` → `docs/briefs/NNN-<task-id>-<topic>.md` (permanent design-decision audit trail). Always name the **entry point** (Step 7.5). **Prefer bundled slices** — when 2-4 related tasks share context and none touches a safety invariant, author one bundled brief instead of multiple atomic briefs. Default posture: bundle when safe; atomize only when required. See `docs/tdd-brief-template.md` "Estimated commit count" for the bundle/atomize criteria.
3. **Update `{{ARCH_DOC}}`** with atomic edits when implementation surfaces architectural detail; cite anchors.
4. **Manage cross-doc invariants** — area `CLAUDE.md` tables mirror `{{ARCH_DOC}}`; field/invariant changes need atomic doc edits in the same round; invariant ones pinned by tests.
5. **Step-2.5 review** — implementer sends the per-test write-up directly; review against spec; reply *approve* / *tweak* / *add missing test*. Frequently catches missing boundary tests. **Load-bearing.** Escalate a critical/safety design Q before signing off.
6. **Step-9 hot routing** (matrix below). Reactive — implementer sends categorized summary; you route each item hot.
7. **Per-slice context check + lead ping** (team mode only) — after Step-10 commit + hot-routing complete, **run `/context-check <team>`** + send the report to lead as a structured ping. Lead processes silently unless threshold tier crossed. See "Per-slice context check + lead ping" section below.
8. **Commit + push** — Conventional Commits + AI trailer (HEREDOC). Push only at `/orchestrate-end` if a remote is configured.
9. **Run `/orchestrate-end` after each implementer `/session-end`** (on user-explicit go OR auto-cycle trigger) — verify hot routing, reconcile checkboxes, Log entry, **triage Carry-forward**, set "Currently in progress."
10. **Scope cuts escalate** — deferments + load-bearing architectural Option A/B/C calls go to the human via the lead; never decide agent-only.
11. **Heavyweight ops** (deploys, env config) — HITL / escalation.

**You typically don't:** write feature code (that's the implementer under `/tdd`).

## Messaging budget

The traffic between teammates is **strictly bounded** by the slash-command checkpoints. **Brief authors MUST NOT instruct extra sends; implementers MUST NOT initiate extras.** Both directions of discipline are required.

### Implementer → Orchestrator (per slice)

| When | What flows | Mandatory? |
|---|---|---|
| **Brief dispatch** | Orchestrator → implementer (one-way). Implementer reads + runs `/tdd <feature>` silently through Steps 0/1/2. | n/a (orch → impl) |
| **Step 2.5** | Implementer → orchestrator: design write-up + per-test descriptions + answers to brief's Step-2.5 questions. Orchestrator reviews → approves OR requests changes. If changes: implementer makes them + re-sends; cycle until approval. | **Mandatory** |
| **Step 7.5** | Implementer → orchestrator **only if a wiring / reachability concern surfaces** that needs your attention. Otherwise silent — the reachability claim rolls into Step 9. | **Conditional** |
| **Step 9** | Implementer → orchestrator: categorized summary + ship/no-ship + draft commit message. Orchestrator replies **commit-message-first** per the routing matrix below; that reply IS the approval to commit. | **Mandatory** |
| **After Step 10 commit** | Implementer → orchestrator: short "done with slice — `<commit hash>`" message. Signals you can dispatch the next brief OR proceed to round-seal. | **Mandatory** |
| **`/session-end`** | Implementer → orchestrator: final session-doc recap. Triggers your `/orchestrate-end`. | **Mandatory at session close** (user-on-demand OR auto-cycle trigger per close-out gating) |

### Orchestrator → Lead (per slice, team mode only)

| When | What flows | Mandatory? |
|---|---|---|
| **Per-slice context-check ping** | Orchestrator → lead: after Step-10 + hot-routing complete, run `/context-check <team>`; send the report as a structured one-line summary to lead. Lead processes silently unless threshold tier crossed. | **Mandatory in team mode**; skip in single-operator mode (no lead) |

**That is the entire budget. Do NOT extend it:**
- **No Step-0 restatement send.** `/tdd` Step 0 is a self-check, not a message. The orchestrator's first signal that the brief parsed correctly is the Step 2.5 write-up.
- **No "ready for review" / "holding" / "FYI" pings between checkpoints.**
- **No crossed-message reconciliations.** If a reply lands referencing stale state, continue from latest; the next checkpoint naturally re-syncs.
- **No hash report after Step 10 except the bounded one above.** One short send naming the commit hash — not a structured report.

**Why bounded:** every extra message increases the chance of crossed-in-flight replies between asynchronous LLM agents working in parallel. Bounded messaging keeps the protocol deterministic, the round narrative readable, and reconciliation overhead at zero.

_(Single-operator fallback: the recipient is "you (the human acting as bridge)" — the budget still applies, just paste between sessions yourself.)_

---

## Per-slice context check + lead ping (team mode only)

**When:** after Step-10 commit + hot-routing complete AND you've received the implementer's "done with slice — `<hash>`" message. This is the slice-boundary trigger.

**What to do (4 steps; should take ≤5 seconds):**

1. **Append per-slice history** for trajectory tracking:
   ```bash
   # The /context-check helper reads from team-history/<team>/<name>.jsonl for
   # the 3-slice rolling growth calc. Snapshot all team members for this slice:
   mkdir -p ~/.claude/team-history/<team>
   for f in ~/.claude/team-registry/*.json; do
     [ "$(jq -r '.team' "$f")" = "<team>" ] || continue
     name=$(jq -r '.name' "$f")
     sid=$(jq -r '.session_id' "$f")
     hb=~/.claude/heartbeats/${sid}.json
     [ -f "$hb" ] || continue
     ctx=$(jq -r '.ctx_pct' "$hb")
     ts=$(date -u +%s)
     echo "{\"ts\":$ts,\"ctx_pct\":$ctx,\"slice_hash\":\"<commit-hash>\"}" >> ~/.claude/team-history/<team>/${name}.jsonl
   done
   ```

2. **Invoke `/context-check <team> --brief`** to get the one-line aggregate. (Use `--brief` for the per-slice ping; reserve full output for manual debugging.)

3. **Send the one-line aggregate to lead via SendMessage** (short summary, structured data):
   ```
   SendMessage to: team-lead
   summary: "slice <hash> ctx-check"
   message: "Slice <hash>: <one-line aggregate from /context-check --brief>"
   ```
   Example messages:
   - `Slice abc123: Team mvp: OK — max ctx 42% (impl)` (silent for lead)
   - `Slice abc123: Team mvp: WARN (impl=71%). Cycle approaching.` (lead surfaces one-liner)
   - `Slice abc123: Team mvp: ACTION (impl=76%). Initiate close-out cycle now.` (lead auto-cycles)

4. **IMMEDIATELY dispatch the next brief — DO NOT wait for the lead's response.** The team-start approval authorized the whole queue; you don't need per-slice authorization. The lead is silent when all-OK and responds only when a tier is crossed; if its cycle instructions arrive asynchronously, treat them as an interrupt: pause whatever you started, follow the cycle instructions, then resume.

**Idle only when:** (a) the active phase has no more queued slices and the user hasn't said what's next, (b) a blocking dependency surfaced and you need user direction, OR (c) the lead instructed `/orchestrate-end` (cycle or end-of-round). After the per-slice ping, your default action is "next slice now" — not "wait for lead."

**Why this matters:**
- Lead can't see ctx_pct without your ping (no other reliable slice-boundary trigger).
- The ping is **structured data, not an awareness ping** — one short line, machine-readable, keeps lead context lean across many slices.
- Per-slice cadence + `--brief` keeps the read/eval cost minimal (≤100 tokens per ping vs full multi-line report).
- Non-blocking dispatch is critical — waiting for the lead causes both orch + impl to idle indefinitely when there's nothing for the lead to say.

**When NOT to ping:** during the auto-cycle flow itself (when the lead has just instructed close-out, your next "slice" is the close-out, not a real slice). Resume per-slice pings after a successor implementer is alive and the next real slice lands.

---

## Step-9 routing matrix (hot-write, not aggregate-at-end) — CANONICAL

> This table is the **single source of truth** for Step-9 routing. `/tdd` Step 9, `/orchestrate-end` Step 2, `docs/scaffolding-reference.md`, and `team-protocol.md` all *point here* rather than re-copying it — change routing once, in this table.

When the implementer sends you a Step 9 summary, route each item **immediately**:

| Step 9 category | Action | When | Sign-off |
|---|---|---|---|
| **Convention candidate** | Write the full lesson prose to `{{CODE_AREA}}LESSONS.md` (next anchor `<a id="N"></a>`) AND add **one index row** to the `{{CODE_AREA}}CLAUDE.md` lessons index: `\| N \| date \| [topic](LESSONS.md#N) \| one-line rule \|`. The row is an **index entry with an anchor link — never the lesson prose**. | Hot — same session | Orchestrator writes; escalate only if it encodes a safety rule |
| **Architecture doc note** | Edit `{{ARCH_DOC}} §X` atomic with the implementation commit | Hot — same commit | Orchestrator writes |
| **Future TODO — belongs to a phase** | Add it as a **normal task checkbox in the correct phase/subphase** of `{{TASK_TRACKER}}` (reference the origin slice). Same destination whether acceptance-blocking or "operational" — if it's in-scope for a phase, it's a task there, not an annotation. | Hot | Orchestrator writes |
| **Future TODO — next-brief working set** | Add to `{{TASK_TRACKER}}` "Carry-forward" with an origin marker `(origin: YYYY-MM-DD <slice-id>)`. Only items the next 1–2 briefs need. Triaged every `/orchestrate-end`. | Hot | Orchestrator writes |
| **Future TODO — out of scope** | This is a **deferment** → **escalate to the human**. On approval, move to the deferred phase or Trims with come-back guidance. | Hot | **Escalate (deferment)** |
| **Cross-doc invariant change** | **Orchestrator writes the row in the `{{CODE_AREA}}CLAUDE.md` cross-doc table + the `{{ARCH_DOC}}` Appendix A row** hot. Implementer does NOT touch these files. Commits stagger — implementer's Step 10 commit lands code+tests; your `/orchestrate-end` round commit lands the doc rows. | Hot — same session (orchestrator-write) | Orchestrator writes; **escalate if a safety invariant changed** |
| **Completed work** | Tick `[ ]` → `[x]` in `{{TASK_TRACKER}}`. Conservative — only `[x]` if complete + verified. Partial → `[ ]` + parenthetical note | Hot | Orchestrator writes |

**Why hot-write matters:** if slice 1 surfaces a convention and you defer to `/session-end`, slice 2 re-discovers the same gotcha. Hot routing means subsequent slices benefit immediately.

**Hot-write ≠ autonomous-write — but the gate is you, not the human.** You write each routed item yourself; you do **not** ask the human per item. The human is looped in **only** for the escalation rows (deferments, safety findings, load-bearing architectural decisions).

**Step-9 response structure — commit message first.** Structure your reply so the **commit message lands before the hot-routing edits**: (1) one-line ship/no-ship sign-off, (2) the complete HEREDOC-ready commit message for Step 10, (3) the hot-routing summary + edits. The implementer needs the message to ship Step 10; hot routing is your parallel work.

**Carry-forward triage discipline:** the matrix routes *next-brief* items INTO Carry-forward. `/orchestrate-end` routes them OUT. Five outcomes per item: DELETE (done) / KEEP (next 1–2 slices) / **INLINE-TARGET (convert to a real task checkbox in the right phase/subphase — not an `Operational TODO` annotation)** / DEFER (escalate) / SPREAD (`last-consumer-slice: <id>`).

---

## Commit cadence (N+2 commits per round)

| When | Who | What | Push? |
|---|---|---|---|
| `/tdd` Step 10 (after Step 9 routing) | Implementer | **Slice's code + tests + manifest only.** Explicit `git add <path>`; never `-A`/`.`; never an orchestrator-territory file. Orchestrator-authored Conventional Commits + AI trailer via HEREDOC. | No |
| `/session-end` Step 7 | Implementer | Session doc (+ any audit-fix tests). `docs(sessions)` / `chore(sessions)`. | No |
| `/orchestrate-end` Step 7 | Orchestrator | `{{TASK_TRACKER}}` + `{{CODE_AREA}}LESSONS.md` + `{{CODE_AREA}}CLAUDE.md` index + `{{ARCH_DOC}}` prose + `docs/briefs/NNN-*.md` + optional orchestrator session doc. **Round terminal commit.** | **Only if a remote exists — to {{GIT_REMOTE}}** |

**Per round:** N slice commits + 1 session-doc commit + 1 round commit = **N + 2**. You author every commit message. Push once at round end (when a remote is configured).

---

## Folding carry-forward into the next /tdd brief

After routing Step 9 hot AND triaging Carry-forward, scan `{{TASK_TRACKER}}` Carry-forward before authoring the next brief. Anything in scope for the next slice gets pulled into the brief's Acceptance Criteria / Files / Step-2.5 questions / Dependencies.

---

## Conventions

Full set in root `CLAUDE.md` (key safety rules, typing posture, commit messages) + area `CLAUDE.md` (forbidden patterns, cross-doc invariants, lessons). Orchestrator-specific reminders: **TDD non-negotiable** for deterministic code (Step 2.5 review between RED + GREEN); **Step 7.5 reachability** every slice; **cross-doc invariants** need atomic doc edits when fields/invariants change; **build order fixed** per the architecture; **push only at `/orchestrate-end`** if a remote exists.

<!-- ▼ EXAMPLE BLOCK: project-specific conventions — the load-bearing rules unique to this project's domain (layer dependency rule, isolation boundaries, forbidden patterns worth restating, safety invariants). ▼ -->

5. **<project-specific convention>.** <...>

<!-- ▲ END EXAMPLE BLOCK ▲ -->

---

## Tools

**Slash commands** — your pair is `/orchestrate-start` + `/orchestrate-end`. Never run `/session-start`/`/session-end` (implementer's). Plus `/tdd`, `/wired`, `/preflight`, `/run-tests`, `/check-arch` (full list + descriptions in root `CLAUDE.md`).

**Subagents** (`.claude/agents/README.md`) — delegate read-heavy codebase research to the **Explore** agent to keep your context lean. Step-8 reviewer agents (`code-quality-reviewer`, `security-reviewer`) run on the implementer side at Step 7→8 if installed; their findings reach you via Step-9 categorization. (Optional: **`brief-drafter`** drafts first-pass briefs from a 3-5 line request — output is DRAFT, you finalize; requires quality trial before standard adoption.)

**Standard tools** — `Read`, `Edit`, `Write`, `Bash`, `Grep`, the `Agent` tool.

---

## Recommended first action

1. Run `/orchestrate-start` (this briefing is loaded by it) → Step 6 conditional pre-orient → Step 7 summary back to user. Don't act yet.
2. Once direction is confirmed, propose the **first unit of work** — default: `{{TASK_TRACKER}}` "Next session target."
3. Author the next `/tdd` brief per `docs/tdd-brief-template.md` → `docs/briefs/NNN-...`. Pre-load Step-2.5 design questions; cite anchors; name the entry point; identify cross-doc invariant impact.
4. Send the brief reference directly to the area's implementer.

---

## Final notes

- A slice landing does **NOT** auto-trigger `/session-end` or `/orchestrate-end` — route Step-9 hot; close out only when the user signals.
- Scope decisions are deferment escalations (category #3). Load-bearing architectural Option A/B/C calls are category #4. Never decide either agent-only.
- Confirm today's date via system context. Active deadlines live in `{{TASK_TRACKER}}`.
