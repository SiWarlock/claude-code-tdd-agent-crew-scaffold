  Derive AND continuously maintain a project's layer documentation in docs/layers/. First run: a deep
  code + planning-artifact comprehension pass that derives the project's REAL layers and writes a
  full-scope overview plus one digestible doc per layer. Later runs are INCREMENTAL — only what changed,
  never clobbering human edits; --check reports staleness. Every claim is file:line-anchored;
  arch-vs-code drift is flagged. Standalone; runs inside the target project; host-neutral (Claude or
  Codex). Writes the doc set /learn-site builds its website from — run this one FIRST. Invoke on
  "layer-docs", "document the layers", "update the layer docs", "refresh the docs", "what docs are stale".

# layer-docs — derive and keep current a project's layer documentation

A **standalone, on-demand** skill that reads a project — **code + its planning/architecture docs** —
understands how it actually works, decides what its **layers** really are, and writes a **clear, faithful doc
set** into `docs/layers/`: one **full-scope overview** plus **one doc per layer**, each opening with an
**executive summary** then going deep while staying easy to read. It is meant to be run **more than once**:
the first run derives the set; later runs **keep it in sync** as the code evolves. Runs on **Claude or
Codex**, from **inside the target repo**. Its output feeds **`/learn-site`** and a project knowledge base.

**It is faithful first.** Every non-trivial claim is anchored to real code (`path:line`); where the
architecture doc says one thing and the code does another, it **flags the drift**; where it isn't sure, it
says so. It **never modifies the project's source** — it only writes docs under `docs/layers/`.

**It derives layers from THIS project**, not from a checklist — and on updates it **only touches what
changed** and **preserves your hand-edits**.

Depth — input sources, layer heuristics, doc templates, readability rules, the faithfulness discipline, and
the **incremental-update mechanics** (change detection, the state file, don't-clobber) — is in
**`references/layer-docs-playbook.md`**. Read it first.

## 0. Asking the user questions (host-neutral — read first)

This skill has gates. Use whatever your host supports to ask:
1. A blocking question tool — `AskUserQuestion` (Claude Code), `request_user_input` / `ask_user` (Codex / other).
2. Else **plain text** — print the question + options, then **stop and wait**.

Discipline: one topic per check-in · recommend an option + **why** · **never invent** a layer, a component,
or a behavior to fill a gap — anchor it in code or mark it `UNVERIFIED` and ask.

---

## Modes (auto-detected; the user can force one)

Decide the mode by whether `docs/layers/` already has a doc set + a state file (`docs/layers/.layer-docs.json`):
- **Initial** — no existing set → do the full derivation (§§1–6, initial path). This is also right when the
  user passes `--full` (force a clean regen) or the set is too stale to update sanely.
- **Update** (default when a set exists) — figure out **what changed** since the docs were last generated and
  refresh **only the affected** docs, preserving human edits. Also right for `--update` or `--layer <name>`.
- **Check** (`--check`) — report which layer docs are **stale** vs the code (and which were hand-edited)
  **without writing anything**. Read-only; safe in CI; this is what a knowledge base / drift detector calls.

State the detected mode up front so the user knows whether you're creating or updating.

## The state file — `docs/layers/.layer-docs.json`

The skill stamps a small machine-owned state file so later runs can detect change without guessing. It records
the generation point and, per layer, the doc, its source globs/files, and a content hash; plus a hash of each
source file at last generation. (Full schema in the playbook.) On every write, **re-stamp it.** It works
without git (hashes are the source of truth); a git sha is stored as fast-path provenance when available.

---

## 1. Gather the inputs — code, docs, and prior state

> *Goal: assemble everything that describes the system, plus what was documented last time.*

1. **Read the state file** if present (`docs/layers/.layer-docs.json`) — it tells you the prior layer set,
   the source→layer mapping, and the last-generation hashes/sha. Absent ⇒ Initial mode.
2. **Map the repo.** `Glob`/`Bash` the tree; find entry points, manifests, structure, tests. If a
   **code-intelligence MCP (CodeGraph)** is available, use it (`codegraph_status`, `codegraph_files`,
   `codegraph_context`) for the symbol/edge map instead of a grep-and-read sweep.
3. **Collect the design record.** `ARCHITECTURE.md`, `docs/planning/*` (the `/arch-draft` artifacts), any
   `/office-hours` or `/plan-ceo-review` output, `IMPLEMENTATION_PLAN.md`, `LESSONS.md`, `README`s, ADRs, API specs.
   No planning docs ⇒ proceed from the **code as source of truth**.

⏸ **Check-in:** confirm the mode + the input inventory before the deep read.

## 2. Build or refresh the system model

> *Goal (Initial): an accurate model of the whole system. Goal (Update): pinpoint exactly what changed.*

**Initial / `--full`:**
1. **Trace the spine.** From each entry point, follow the main flows (`codegraph_trace`/`codegraph_callees`
   when available, else targeted reads). Identify major modules, data flow, external deps, seams.
2. **Check framework facts** with a docs MCP (Context7) when library behavior matters — don't guess.
3. **Cross-reference intent vs reality** — hold the architecture/planning docs next to the code; record
   agreement and **drift**.
4. **Large codebase?** Fan out `Explore` subagents (via `Agent`) over subsystems in parallel; synthesize
   yourself.

**Update / Check — detect what changed (the core of incremental mode):**
1. **Diff the sources** since the state file's generation point: prefer `git diff --name-status <generatedAt>..HEAD`;
   otherwise re-hash the source tree and compare to the stored `sourceHashes`. Produce **changed / added /
   deleted / renamed** file lists. Use `codegraph_impact` when available to widen to truly affected symbols.
2. **Map changes to layers** via each layer's stored `sourceGlobs` **and** the `file:line` anchors already in
   the layer docs. Result: the set of **affected layers** (plus the overview if the layer map itself shifts).
3. **Spot the unmapped.** Added files that fit **no** existing layer are a signal of a **possible new layer**
   (or a reassignment) — hold them for the §3 gate. Deleted files mean content to prune.
4. **Detect human edits.** For each layer doc, compare its current file hash to the stored `docHash`. A
   mismatch means **a human edited it** — that doc is now partly hand-owned; you must preserve those edits
   (§5), not overwrite them.

⏸ **Check-in:** Initial → share the system model. Update → present the **change report**: which layers are
affected, what's new/unmapped, which docs were hand-edited. (Check mode **stops here** with that report — it
writes nothing.)

## 3. Layers — derive (initial) or reconcile (update)

> *Goal: keep the decomposition correct — it drives every doc.*

- **Initial:** propose the layer list derived from the real structure/responsibilities (only the layers this
  project actually has, named the way it names them), each with a one-line scope + anchoring evidence; note
  anything that doesn't fit cleanly. **Pause for the user to confirm/adjust** (merge, split, rename, add, drop).
- **Update:** the layer set usually holds. Only when §2 surfaced an **unmapped new area** or a removed one do
  you propose a change (new layer · merge · rename · retire) — and **pause** for that decision. If the set is
  unchanged, say so and proceed without a gate.

## 4. Overview — write (initial) or update on map change

> *Goal: the whole system at a glance, kept honest.*

- **Initial:** write **`docs/layers/OVERVIEW.md`** — what the project is/does · the **layer map** + a simple
  flow diagram · cross-cutting concerns · stack · key decisions + flagged drift · a **TOC linking every layer
  doc**. Exec-summary energy up top; skimmable.
- **Update:** refresh the overview **only if** the layer map, the flow, the stack, or the cross-cutting story
  changed; otherwise leave it. Always re-check the TOC links and any "last updated" line.

## 5. Layer docs — write all (initial) or update only the affected (don't clobber)

> *Goal: a digestible deep-dive per layer — summary first, depth below — kept current without losing edits.*

- **Initial:** write **`docs/layers/NN-<slug>.md`** for each confirmed layer, per the playbook template
  (executive summary → responsibilities · key files (`path:line`) · interfaces · data · deps in/out ·
  control/data flow · decisions+rationale · gotchas · connections). Readable: short paragraphs, bullets, a
  small diagram, real code refs over prose.
- **Update:** rewrite **only the affected** layer docs (and add a doc for a confirmed new layer; retire a
  removed one). For each:
  - **If the doc was hand-edited** (§2.4): do **not** overwrite it wholesale. Update the stale **sections**
    (the template's sections are stable), leave hand-written prose intact, and if a human edit now conflicts
    with the code, **flag it for the user** rather than silently resolving — same don't-clobber discipline as
    `scaffold-upgrade`.
  - Refresh `path:line` anchors that moved; prune references to deleted code; add new components.

## 6. Cross-check, cross-link, and stamp state

> *Goal: leave the set trustworthy, navigable, and re-syncable.*

1. **Coverage:** every major component appears in some layer doc; nothing important is orphaned.
2. **Faithfulness:** spot-check `path:line` anchors resolve and match the code; mark residual `UNVERIFIED`.
3. **Navigation:** the overview TOC + inter-layer links resolve.
4. **Stamp `docs/layers/.layer-docs.json`** — update the per-layer source globs, the new `docHash`es, the
   `sourceHashes`, and the generation sha. (Without this, the next run can't detect change.)

⏸ **Check-in:** confirm the set; offer the next steps — **`/learn-site`** to (re)build the learning site, and
a **knowledge-base sync** to replace the changed docs' chunks (the updated docs are content-hash-replaceable).

---

## Hard rules (forbidden)

- **Faithful to the real code** — anchor claims to `path:line`; **never invent** components, behavior, or
  layers. Unsure → mark `UNVERIFIED` and ask.
- **Incremental by default when a set exists** — detect what changed and touch **only** the affected docs;
  don't silently rewrite the whole set (use `--full` for that, and say so).
- **Never clobber human edits** — a doc whose hash drifted from the state file is partly hand-owned; update
  its stale sections, preserve the prose, and flag genuine conflicts instead of resolving them silently.
- **Derive layers from THIS project** — no boilerplate taxonomy; on update, only change the layer set behind
  the §3 gate.
- **Flag drift** between the architecture/planning docs and the actual code; don't silently pick one.
- **Docs only** — never modify the project's source.
- **Executive-summary-first and readable** — each doc opens with the gist; optimize for a human learning the
  system.
- **Always stamp the state file** on any write; **`--check` writes nothing.**
- **Pause on layer-set changes** (§3) and the final set (§6).
- **Prefer CodeGraph/Context7 when available** for structure/impact and framework facts; fall back gracefully.
